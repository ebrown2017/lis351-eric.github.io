                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I attended San Diego State University
                        for a year and a half before I transfered here to UW-Madison in the Spring of 2019.
                        I am a Senior here studying Comuter Science. After my graduation I plan on returning to
                        San Diego to work as a Software Engineer. I have a dog named Ginger. She is a rescue dog from
                        Rosarito Mexico. Once I graduate, I really would like to but a Mazda Miata. It is a converatable
                        car that I really would like to own and drive daily.

                    <h3>My gap year</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the 2020-2021 school year I decided to take a gap year to work in San Diego.
                        In this year, I worked for a company in San Diego called JetHead Inc. While there
                        I worked as a Software Engineer.
