                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I attended San Diego State University
                    for a year and a half before I transfered here to UW-Madison in the Spring of 2019.
                    I am a Senior here studying Comuter Science. After my graduation I plan on returning to
                    San Diego to work as a Software Engineer. I have a dog named Ginger. She is a rescue dog from
                    Rosarito Mexico. Once I graduate, I really would like to but a Mazda Miata. It is a converatable
                    car that I really would like to own and drive daily.
                </p>

                <h3>Gap Year</h3>
                <p>
                    For the 2020-2021 school year I decided to take a gap year to work in San Diego.
                    In this year, I worked for a company in San Diego called JetHead Inc. While there
                    I worked as a Software Engineer.
                </p>
                <a>I got a few things out of working that year</a>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Programming Knowledge</dt>
                    <dd>I programmed in C++ everyday. I also learned source control through Git commands.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>Social Skills</dt>
                    <dd>I worked on a team of around 10 people so I had to learn how to communicate ideas quick. I also learned of the importance of being supportive to those around you</dd>

                    <dt>Money Management</dt>
                    <dd>With a job, I had to learn how to wisely use my money. I learned a lot about the importance of investing in retirement early. I also learned how to budget.</dd>
