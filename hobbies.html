                <h4>Soccer</h4>
                <p>
                    Soccer is one of the sports I've played my whole life. Ever since I was able to walk I was kicking a ball.
                    I love to play as often as I can. Now a days, I mostly play indoor Futsal at the Nic rec center.
                    There, I play pickup games. I mainly play defense because I am tall, but I do prefer to play striker.

                <h4>Gaming</h4>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy playing video games with my friends in my free time. My favorite games are Call of Duty Warzone
                    and Rocket League. I think that the fast paced competative aspect of games is what draws me in. I am pretty good
                    at warzone, in fact my K/D is about 2.2. Want to see my Warzone stats?

                <h4>Photography</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my last hobbies is photography. I own a drone that allows me to take aerial photos of whatever I want.
                    I find it really cool and relaxing to operate the drone and also get gorgeous pictures of landscapes.
                    I publish my work on an instagram profile. If you would like to view my photos click below.
